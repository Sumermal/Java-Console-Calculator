## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Clone the Repository:

        First, download the project from GitHub:
        git clone https://github.com/Sumermal/Java-Consule-Calculator.git

        This will create a folder your-repo-name containing the project files.

2. Open in an IDE:

        Open IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE).

        Choose Open → Select the project folder you cloned.

        Make sure ConsoleCalculator.java is inside the src/ directory.

3. Compile and Run:

        Run in IntelliJ :

        Right-click ConsoleCalculator.java → Run 'ConsoleCalculator.main()'

        The program will open in the console, displaying the menu.
   
4. Using the Calculator

The program will show a menu with operations:

        1. Addition (+)
        2. Subtraction (-)
        3. Multiplication (*)
        4. Division (/)
        5. Modulus (%)
        6. Power (x^y)
        7. Square Root (√x)
        8. Factorial (n!)
        9. Show History
        10. Exit


        Enter the number of the operation, then input your numbers.

        Results will display immediately.

        Option 9 shows the history of all calculations.

        Option 10 exits the calculator.

  5. Notes:

          Division by zero → returns NaN.

         Square root of negative numbers → returns NaN.

          Factorial only supports non-negative integers.
